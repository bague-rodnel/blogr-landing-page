## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap 5
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Bootstrap defaults can be overriden through cascaded css declarations. It's only when there is a need to streamline/map Bootstrap keywords (i.e. -primary -secondary ...) to custom colors that a compiling a custom version of Bootstrap sass should be considered.
